# Unofficial Eskom

[Eskom](https://www.eskom.co.za), the South African electricity public utility,  provides some information about the ongoing [South Africa energy crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_energy_crisis). 

However, the official data is often badly presented or hard to find. This is an unofficial site that aggregates the most useful information and makes it easier to find, nicer to look at, and generally more accessible.

We aggregate data from:

* The Eskom [data portal](https://www.eskom.co.za/dataportal/).
* The Eskom [Integrated results](https://www.eskom.co.za/investors/integrated-results/).
* The Eskom [presentations](https://www.eskom.co.za/media-room/presentations/).
* The Eskom [weekly system status reports](https://www.eskom.co.za/eskom-divisions/tx/system-adequacy-reports/).
* The Eskom [media statements](https://www.eskom.co.za/category/news/) and [Twitter feed](http://twitter.com/eskom_sa).
* [EskomSePush (ESP)](https://sepush.co.za).

**WIP - not everything above is actually live yet. Stay tuned.**
