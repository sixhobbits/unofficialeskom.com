# Unofficial Eskom

[Eskom](https://www.eskom.co.za), the South African electricity public utility,  provides some information about the ongoing [South Africa energy crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_energy_crisis). 

However, the official data is often badly presented or hard to find. This is an unofficial site that aggregates the most useful information and makes it easier to find, nicer to look at, and generally more accessible.

Mainly this is collected in the [Unofficial Eskom Data Portal](https://metabase.dwyer.co.za/public/dashboard/d3b40619-d8f0-4be3-a1f2-99fe5b84e961) which is based on the short-term data, published on the eskom data portal and updated every few days (automatically, when Eskom publishes new CSV datasets on their site). The data goes back to October 2022.

There is also the [long term dashboard](https://metabase.dwyer.co.za/public/dashboard/8a1e3f60-e53f-44c4-b045-cdcb35254ecb) that has data going back to April 2017, updated once per month.

But you can also find some other information around at the [Dashboards](./dashboards), and a [heatmap](./heatmap) showing a calendar overview of loadshedding since 2015.

Here's a gif showing average OCGT generator use. These are the diesel generators meant for emergencies and to help with the 6pm demand peak, but which have been used often non-stop in the past few years.
