# Dashboards

The graphs below (and others) are also available, without the descriptions, at:

Eskom generates most of its power from aging coal power plants. When demand is larger than supply, Eskom does manual "load reduction" to make up the difference.

This graph shows total generation, thermal generation (coal), load reduction and generation + reduction (which should be greater than demand to prevent a grid collapse) on a daily basis.

## Energy availability factor and outages

Eskom's most important KPI is "EAF" or "Energy availability factor". This is usually given as a percentage representing how much of their theoretical generation capability is actually producing power. The rest is split between "PCLF" (planned capability loss factor, or units that are down for planned maintenance), "UCLF" (unplanned capability loss factor, or units that are down due to breakdowns), and "OCLF" (other capability loss factor or units that are out "due to constraints out of the power station management control". This graph shows EAF, PLCF, UCLF, and OCLF. View a larger version [here](https://metabase.dwyer.co.za/public/question/d3c78719-cc25-44b4-8e74-5accced27b88).

The same metrics can also be calculated in absolute MW instead of as a percentage of installed capacity, as shown below. Or see a larger version [here](https://metabase.dwyer.co.za/public/question/db2e50a8-abd1-41b4-b561-16145008ac79).

## OCTG Usage

Eskom has Open Cycle Gas Turbines (OCGTs) which burn diesel to generate power. These were intended to be used only as a last resort for peak demand during emergency breakdowns of the regular plants as they are not efficient and very expensive to run. However they are now regularly used to reduce the gap between supply and demand whenever Eskom has diesel available. Eskom has its own OCGTs and also buys power from some owned by Independent Power Producers. The graph below shows utilization rate of Eskom's OCTTs.
